The pcb and sch files were created with the ExpressPCB and ExpressSCH
programs, available at http://www.expresspcb.com/. To have the PCB
made, run ExpressPCB, open the RS232 interface .pcb file and select
"Layout" and "Order Boards via the Internet".  Use miniboard service
to get three boards made for about $60. As there are four RS232
interfaces per board, you will be able to make twelve interfaces.
